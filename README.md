# Agentic Workflows

A collection of AI-powered workflows and automation patterns designed to streamline repository management, code review, documentation, and other development tasks using intelligent agents.

## Overview

Agentic Workflows leverages AI agents to automate complex development workflows through natural language instructions. This repository contains reusable workflow patterns that can be adapted to various automation scenarios, enabling teams to build intelligent, self-organizing processes that enhance productivity and code quality.

## Features

- **Natural Language Workflow Definition**: Define complex automation tasks using plain language instead of traditional scripting
- **Modular Architecture**: Reusable workflow components that can be composed into larger automation pipelines
- **Multi-Agent Coordination**: Orchestrate multiple specialized agents working together on complex tasks
- **GitHub Integration**: Seamless integration with GitHub Actions, issues, pull requests, and other repository features
- **Extensible Design**: Easy to customize and extend with new workflow patterns
- **Security-First Approach**: Built with security best practices including sandboxed execution and scoped permissions

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- GitHub account with repository access
- Basic understanding of GitHub Actions (optional but helpful)
- Access to an LLM provider (OpenAI, Anthropic Claude, or similar)

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/palscruz23/agentic-workflows.git
cd agentic-workflows
```

2. Set up your environment variables:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your API keys and configuration
```

3. Install dependencies (if applicable):
```bash
npm install
# or
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Quick Start

To get started with a basic workflow:

1. Choose a workflow template from the `workflows/` directory
2. Copy it to your `.github/workflows/` directory
3. Customize the workflow parameters and instructions
4. Commit and push to trigger the workflow

Example:
```bash
cp workflows/issue-triage.yml .github/workflows/
git add .github/workflows/issue-triage.yml
git commit -m "Add issue triage workflow"
git push
```

## Workflow Patterns

This repository includes several workflow patterns:

### Issue Management
- **Issue Triage**: Automatically categorize, label, and prioritize incoming issues
- **Issue Clarification**: Request additional information when issues lack detail
- **Duplicate Detection**: Identify and link duplicate issues

### Code Quality
- **Code Review Assistant**: Provide intelligent code review feedback on pull requests
- **Documentation Generator**: Automatically generate or update documentation
- **Test Coverage Analysis**: Analyze test coverage and suggest improvements

### Development Automation
- **Daily Standup**: Generate automated status reports from repository activity
- **Dependency Updates**: Monitor and create PRs for dependency updates
- **CI/CD Doctor**: Investigate and diagnose CI/CD failures

### Custom Workflows
Create your own workflows by combining reusable components and defining custom instructions.

├── workflows/           # Workflow definition files
├── agents/             # Agent configurations and specializations
├── tools/              # Custom tools and utilities

└── tests/              # Test suite
```

## Configuration

Workflows can be configured using YAML frontmatter:

```yaml
---
on:
  issues:
    types: [opened]
permissions:
  read-all
safe-outputs:
  add-comment: true
---

# Your workflow instructions here
```

### Available Triggers
- Issue events (opened, labeled, commented)
- Pull request events (opened, updated, reviewed)
- Push events
- Schedule (cron)
- Manual triggers (workflow_dispatch)

### Permissions Model
Workflows follow a principle of least privilege with explicit permission declarations.

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Automated Issue Labeling

```markdown
---
on:
  issues:
    types: [opened]
permissions:
  issues: write
---

# Issue Labeler

Analyze the issue title and description, then:
1. Determine the appropriate labels (bug, feature, documentation, etc.)
2. Assess the priority level (low, medium, high)
3. Apply the labels to the issue
```

### Example 2: Pull Request Review Assistant

```markdown
---
on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, synchronize]
permissions:
  pull-requests: write
  contents: read
---

# PR Review Helper

Review the pull request changes and:
1. Check for common code quality issues
2. Verify test coverage
3. Suggest improvements
4. Add a summary comment with findings
```

## Best Practices

1. **Start Small**: Begin with simple workflows and gradually increase complexity
2. **Monitor Closely**: Review agent actions regularly, especially during initial deployment
3. **Use Safe Outputs**: Leverage controlled write operations to minimize risk
4. **Document Intent**: Clearly describe what each workflow should accomplish
5. **Test Thoroughly**: Validate workflows in a test repository before production use
6. **Iterate and Refine**: Continuously improve workflow instructions based on results

## Security Considerations

- All workflows run in sandboxed environments
- Read-only permissions are the default
- Write operations require explicit safe-output declarations
- Secrets are managed through GitHub's secure secrets management
- Regular security audits are recommended

## Contributing

We welcome contributions! Here's how you can help:

1. **Fork the Repository**: Create your own fork to work on changes
2. **Create a Branch**: Use descriptive branch names (e.g., `feature/new-workflow`)
3. **Make Changes**: Follow existing patterns and add documentation
4. **Test Thoroughly**: Ensure your workflows work as expected
5. **Submit a Pull Request**: Provide a clear description of your changes

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for detailed guidelines.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Workflow not triggering**
- Verify your trigger configuration in the workflow frontmatter
- Check that the workflow file is in `.github/workflows/`
- Ensure the workflow is enabled in your repository settings

**Permission errors**
- Review the permissions declared in your workflow
- Verify that your API keys are correctly configured
- Check GitHub Actions permissions in repository settings

**Unexpected agent behavior**
- Review the workflow instructions for clarity
- Check the execution logs in GitHub Actions
- Consider breaking complex workflows into smaller steps

## Roadmap

- [ ] Additional workflow templates
- [ ] Enhanced multi-agent coordination patterns
- [ ] Integration with more development tools
- [ ] Improved error handling and recovery
- [ ] Web UI for workflow management
- [ ] Analytics and insights dashboard
