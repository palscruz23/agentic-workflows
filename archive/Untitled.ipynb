      "- Mill context: SAG mills; study uses DEM simulations combined with impact-force metrics to assess liner damage (fatigue and wear). Multiple cases with varying mill speed, total charge, ball (pebble) charge and liner wear condition (nominal, half-worn, fully-worn).\n",
      "- Key findings:\n",
      "  - Liner survivability is governed by two mechanisms: fatigue crack propagation (impact events, bolt fatigue) and abrasive wear. The DEM-derived impact-force-based damage-rate index correlates with expected fatigue life.\n",
      "  - Increased mill speed (examples around 9.0‚Äì9.6 rpm shown in figures) and changes in liner profile (half-worn vs fully-worn) substantially alter fatigue life. Figures 14‚Äì15 show fatigue-life comparisons (days) across cases.\n",
      "  - A higher total charge with lower ball (pebble) charge reduces impact damage risk (figure data & commentary). In plotted cases, combinations with higher total charge and lower ball charge produced higher fatigue life (numerical examples in figure captions).\n",
      "- Quantitative relationships / ranges (from figures & captions):\n",
      "  - Example fatigue life values (figure 14 / 15): fatigue life ranges from ~244 to ~533 days across cases plotted (varies with Jb, Jt, mill speed and liner wear state).\n",
      "  - Mill speed effect: a half-worn condition at 9.2‚Äì9.6 rpm vs nominal 9.0 rpm changed computed fatigue life noticeably (figures show increases or decreases up to ~2√ó in some comparisons).\n",
      "  - Impact/damage metrics tied to DEM-calculated impulse/force frequency distributions; the paper reports damage-rate indices (no single closed-form equation provided in draft ‚Äî relationships are empirical/DEM-derived).\n",

      "- Key findings:\n",
      "  - Liner wear alters internal mill geometry leading to changes in: cascade/ cataracting trajectories, impact energy distributions, pulp hold-up and discharge behavior; these in turn affect throughput and grind size.\n",
      "  - Worn liners (flattened profiles) reduce top-of-shell lift, shifting the charge motion from cataracting to rolling; that tends to reduce impact breakage but may increase attrition and lower overall grinding efficiency for coarse breakage.\n",

      "## Introduction\n",
      "This report synthesizes findings from five selected sources (DEM simulation study, an industry case paper, OEM technical literature and background material) on how operational parameters influence liner wear mechanisms in semi-autogenous grinding (SAG) mills. Primary wear mechanisms considered are: impact (fatigue) damage, abrasive wear, and corrosion / tribocorrosion. Emphasis is on directional effects and reported quantitative examples while noting that numerical results are generally site- and model-specific.\n",
      "\n",

      "Overview\n",
      "- Consensus across sources: mill speed, charge composition (total charge and ball/pebble fraction), liner geometry/state, feed size/hardness and discharge/grate condition are the primary operational controls of liner loading and wear. OEMs and academic work emphasize that quantitative prediction requires site-specific modelling or measurement.\n",
      "\n",
      "### A. Mill speed (% of critical speed, Nc)\n",
      "Mechanisms affected\n",
      "- Impact / fatigue: Primary control. Higher speed generally increases particle/media cataracting, impact energy and impulse frequency ‚Üí higher fatigue loading on liners and bolts.\n",
      "- Abrasion: Indirect; speed changes shift charge motion and contact sliding regimes, altering abrasive exposure.\n",
      "- Corrosion: Indirect via changed slurry hold-up patterns.\n",
      "\n",
      "Quantitative notes and provenance\n",
      "- OEM/background guidance: SAG mills commonly operate in the approximate 65‚Äì80% Nc band; many references cite ~70‚Äì80% Nc for SAG duties [3,4,5].\n",
      "- Saxena et al. (DEM cases): modest rpm changes in their modeled mill (examples ‚âà 9.0‚Äì9.6 rpm in the draft) produced large sensitivity in computed fatigue life. Reported fatigue-life estimates across modeled cases ‚âà 244‚Äì533 days, with life varying up to ~2√ó for some speed/charge/profile combinations [1].\n",

      "Quantitative notes and provenance\n",
      "- Saxena et al.: DEM runs showed configurations with higher total charge and lower ball (pebble) fraction produced lower impact-damage indices and longer computed fatigue life in their modeled scenarios [1].\n",

      "- Liner wear leads to altered charge dynamics, tending to reduce cataracting and increase rolling/attrition, with consequences for both wear mode and production performance.\n",
      "\n",
      "### D. Feed size and hardness\n",
      "Mechanisms affected\n",
      "- Abrasion: Primary control. Coarser and harder feed increases abrasive severity and accelerates liner thinning.\n",

       "# AG Mill Liner Wear vs Operational Parameters\n",
       "\n",
       "## Introduction\n",
       "This report synthesizes findings from five selected sources (DEM simulation study, an industry case paper, OEM technical literature and background material) on how operational parameters influence liner wear mechanisms in semi-autogenous grinding (SAG) mills. Primary wear mechanisms considered are: impact (fatigue) damage, abrasive wear, and corrosion / tribocorrosion. Emphasis is on directional effects and reported quantitative examples while noting that numerical results are generally site- and model-specific.\n",
       "\n",
       "Sources used (full citations in References) include:\n",
       "- Saxena et al., COMMINUTION ‚Äô23 DEM study with computed fatigue-life comparisons and a damage-rate index [1].\n",
       "- An industry/engineering paper on liner-wear effects and plant case studies (ResearchGate) [2].\n",
       "- OEM technical guidance and case materials from FLSmidth [3] and Metso Outotec [4].\n",
       "- Background definitions and typical operating ranges from Wikipedia [5].\n",
       "\n",
       "## Findings (organized by parameter and mechanism)\n",
       "\n",
       "Overview\n",
       "- Consensus across sources: mill speed, charge composition (total charge and ball/pebble fraction), liner geometry/state, feed size/hardness and discharge/grate condition are the primary operational controls of liner loading and wear. OEMs and academic work emphasize that quantitative prediction requires site-specific modelling or measurement.\n",
       "\n",
       "### A. Mill speed (% of critical speed, Nc)\n",
       "Mechanisms affected\n",
       "- Impact / fatigue: Primary control. Higher speed generally increases particle/media cataracting, impact energy and impulse frequency ‚Üí higher fatigue loading on liners and bolts.\n",
       "- Abrasion: Indirect; speed changes shift charge motion and contact sliding regimes, altering abrasive exposure.\n",
       "- Corrosion: Indirect via changed slurry hold-up patterns.\n",
       "\n",
       "Quantitative notes and provenance\n",
       "- OEM/background guidance: SAG mills commonly operate in the approximate 65‚Äì80% Nc band; many references cite ~70‚Äì80% Nc for SAG duties [3,4,5].\n",
       "- Saxena et al. (DEM cases): modest rpm changes in their modeled mill (examples ‚âà 9.0‚Äì9.6 rpm in the draft) produced large sensitivity in computed fatigue life. Reported fatigue-life estimates across modeled cases ‚âà 244‚Äì533 days, with life varying up to ~2√ó for some speed/charge/profile combinations [1].\n",
       "\n",
       "Operational implication (directional)\n",
       "- Increasing speed ‚Üí increased impact severity and reduced fatigue life (subject to interactions with charge and liner profile).\n",
       "\n",
       "### B. Total charge and ball/pebble fraction (Jt, Jb)\n",
       "Mechanisms affected\n",
       "- Impact / fatigue: Strong control. Charge composition determines cushioning vs. discrete impacts and influences impact frequency and intensity.\n",
       "- Abrasion: Filling/media fraction affects the balance of impact breakage vs attrition and thus sliding/abrasive exposure.\n",
       "\n",
       "Quantitative notes and provenance\n",
       "- Saxena et al.: DEM runs showed configurations with higher total charge and lower ball (pebble) fraction produced lower impact-damage indices and longer computed fatigue life in their modeled scenarios [1].\n",
       "- OEMs identify charge makeup as a primary lever for controlling impact severity and liner loading [3,4].\n",
       "\n",
       "Operational implication (directional)\n",
       "- Higher total charge with lower added-ball fraction can reduce impact damage indices in some cases (DEM-backed) but outcomes are mill- and ore-specific.\n",
       "\n",
       "### C. Liner geometry, profile and wear state\n",
       "Mechanisms affected\n",
       "- Impact / fatigue: Worn liners reduce lift and change impact locations; changing profile shifts cataracting vs rolling regimes and the distribution of high-energy impacts.\n",
       "- Abrasion: Flattened/worn profiles increase regions of sliding/attrition and local abrasive thinning.\n",
       "\n",
       "Quantitative notes and provenance\n",
       "- Saxena et al.: Showed distinct damage-rate index distributions and different fatigue-life estimates for nominal, half-worn and fully-worn liner geometries in DEM comparisons [1].\n",
       "- Industry case studies report throughput and grind changes as liners evolve (new ‚Üí half-worn ‚Üí fully worn) due to altered charge motion and impact/attrition balance [2].\n",
       "\n",
       "Operational implication (directional)\n",
       "- Liner wear leads to altered charge dynamics, tending to reduce cataracting and increase rolling/attrition, with consequences for both wear mode and production performance.\n",
       "\n",
       "### D. Feed size and hardness\n",
       "Mechanisms affected\n",
       "- Abrasion: Primary control. Coarser and harder feed increases abrasive severity and accelerates liner thinning.\n",
       "- Impact / fatigue: Coarse/hard feed benefits from cataracting impact; insufficient liner lift/profile to promote cataracting reduces breakage efficiency.\n",
       "\n",
       "Quantitative notes and provenance\n",
       "- Industry paper: Case-specific plots show throughput and power dependence on feed size in conjunction with liner-wear stage; no universal formula‚Äîresults are plant dependent [2].\n",
       "- OEM literature: Advises matching liner profile/material to feed characteristics to control wear and maintain grinding efficiency [3,4].\n",
       "\n",
       "Operational implication (directional)\n",
       "- Hard/coarse feed ‚Üí higher abrasive wear; requires liner/profile/material choices that sustain desired charge motion.\n",
       "\n",
       "### E. Discharge / grate condition and pulp retention\n",
       "Mechanisms affected\n",
       "- Abrasion & operational performance: Grate opening/wear alters pulp level and retention time ‚Üí changes slurry exposure of liners and circulating load/classification behavior.\n",
